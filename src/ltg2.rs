            to have future objects as a type which are of type Future trait we have to

            on that in later scopes to unpin the boxed value from the ram to get the result

        Closure Case: In the closure example, the closure captures the environment in 
            which it's defined. This includes the value 34, which is actually stored 
            within the closure itself. As a result, the reference &34 is valid for 
            the lifetime of the closure.

        Function Case: In the function example, there's no environment to capture.
            The value 45 is a temporary value created within the function and destroyed 
            when the function returns. Consequently, you can't safely return a reference to it.
        
        When we try to return a reference to a temporary value, we'll usually encounter a 
        compilation error stating that you're trying to return a reference to a local variable, 
        which is deallocated after the function returns. In summary, closures can capture 
        and own their environment, so they can safely return references to it. Functions can't 
        do that, so returning a reference to a temporary value is not safe.

        in other words returning reference from the closure is safe cause they'll capture the
        type into their own scope which allows us to borrow them thus return a pointer to them
        but for the functions, since there is no capturing process during the execution thus
        everything will be created inside the function body and is limited to that scope, so 
        we can't return a reference (without valid lifetime like static or the lifetime of self)
        to the type cause there is no value for it to be borrowed from because local types inside
        the function will be dropped once the function gets executed on the stack.

            if we want to take a mutable pointer to a future object then the future object 
            must implements the Unpin trait, because pinning will lock the object into the ram
            and makes its location stable in there and doesn't allow to move or mutate that object
            also it doesn't allow to obtain Box<T> or &mut T thus we must unpin the object first
            the following is the general explanation of this:

            By default, all types in Rust are movable. Rust allows passing all types by-value, 
            and common smart-pointer types such as Box<T> and &mut T allow replacing and moving 
            the values they contain: you can move out of a Box<T>, or you can use mem::swap. 
            Pin<P> wraps a pointer type P, so Pin<Box<T>> functions much like a regular Box<T>: 
            when a Pin<Box<T>> gets dropped, so do its contents, and the memory gets deallocated. 
            Similarly, Pin<&mut T> is a lot like &mut T. However, Pin<P> does not let clients 
            actually obtain a Box<T> or &mut T to pinned data, which implies that you cannot use 
            operations such as mem::swap


            future objects are traits and can be implemented for other types to convert those
            types into a future objects, also they can return any type as their result of solving
            process by default rust moves heap data types when we go to new scopes unless we borrow 
            them thus for future objects which are of type traits and traits are heap data types 
            we must pin their Box into memory since we don't know when they will be solved and 
            where the scope will be hence, we must bound the pointer of the pinned object to the 
            Unpin trait if we want to move it or take a pointer to it 

            we can get the result of impl Future<Output=String> simply by awaiting on the future 
            object but we can't await on an immutable pointer to a future object or &impl Future<Output=String>
            because :
                Unpin can makes type to be moved safely after being pinned for example if we want to 
                use mem::replace on T which has been pinned into the ram, the T must be bounded to 
                Unpin, also mem::replace works for any !Unpin data and any &mut T not just when T: Unpin
                in essence we can't use mem::replace on a pinned object like the pointer of future objects
                cause we can't get &mut T from it which means we must unpin the future object first then
                put it behind a mutable reference finally we can use mem::replace over that, remember that 
                using mem::replace over types requires that both of them be behind a &mut pointer since 
                this method will replace the location of both types in ram which a mutable process, 
                based on above notes, awaiting on an immutable pointer to a future object requires some 
                kinda replacing and moving operations which forces the object to behind a mutable pointer
                to it's type and be bounded to Unpin trait if we need to access the pinned value outside 
                of the current scope that we're awaiting on the object
